                    Metroid Prime: Federation Force is a cooperative multiplayer action video game for Nintendo 3DS.[1] Announced at E3 on June 16, 2015, it was developed by Next Level Games. The game focuses on a team of Federation Marines, the Federation Force, rather than Samus Aran. The gameplay has more of a focus on action and sports rather than exploration as in past Metroid games. Prior to the game's release, Metroid Prime: Blast Ball was made available on the European and American eShop as a free demo of the game's Blast Ball game mode. Metroid Prime: Federation Force was negatively received by fans after its official reveals and received mixed reviews by critics upon release.

                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
